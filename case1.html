            I contributed to the design and prototyping of over 200+ screens across Bombardier’s myMaintenance and myService apps. For the myMaintenance app, I worked on workflows that simplified aircraft maintenance tasks and improved field usability for technicians. For the myService app, I focused on service intake and status tracking screens, ensuring consistency and accessibility.
            Additionally, I led the UX design process for the Partnership Portal from initial ideation to MVP, working independently as the sole designer to deliver key sections including dashboards, campaign tracking, and analytics reporting.

This involved rebuilding key UI components, creating shared libraries, and onboarding the broader team to the new system. This migration significantly improved collaboration, reduced design inconsistencies, and enabled faster design iterations across teams.

              <h6>Process</h6>
              <p class="text-muted">
                I worked as part of a cross-functional Agile team, collaborating daily with Product Managers, Engineers, Scrum Leads, UX Designers, QA, and external consultants to move projects from idea to release. My role required me to actively contribute across all phases of the product lifecycle — from early discovery and sprint planning to backlog refinement and product delivery.
              </p>
              <p class="text-muted">
                My design process followed an end-to-end product workflow:
                Starting with problem discovery and ideation sessions, I moved into user research, low-fidelity wireframing, and iterative high-fidelity mockups that were continuously validated through user and stakeholder feedback. I was involved in shaping product goals, refining sprint tasks, and translating complex user needs into actionable designs.
              </p>
              <p class="text-muted">
                I was actively involved in backlog management, where I prioritized features, refined Jira tickets, and worked closely with PMs to ensure all stories were sprint-ready. I also supported the team’s sprint execution by documenting product flows, edge cases, and user stories on Confluence, ensuring smooth handoffs across design and engineering teams.
              </p>

              <p class="text-muted">
                I regularly worked with both internal teams and external consultants, facilitating design visioning sessions, gathering diverse feedback, and aligning product goals across departments.

                      Working on Bombardier’s digital platforms pushed me to grow as a designer and product manager. I learned how to ship high-impact tools within an enterprise Agile environment while balancing user needs, technical constraints, and stakeholder priorities.
                      
                      Leading the design system migration to Figma helped me understand the value of scalable design, while the MVP work on the Partnership Portal sharpened my skills in lean product strategy. I also deepened my ability to work cross-functionally and facilitate alignment between engineering, UX, and business teams.
